Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I\\'m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it\\'s stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I\\'m giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qMHHuzF3buCl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":55},"outputId":"e4e76f30-61c8-426d-aa72-da941614bba9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562858745729,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2685,"user":{"displayName":"Minh Vo","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PsBBdGPNVOw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADA/CmfH3vaDIEk/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"14774517055753357846"}}},"source":["normalize_corpus([rev])"],"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['first let us get thing straight anime fan always matter fact use watch speed racer time preschool b like several b movie hilarious c like godzilla movies lot move movie first come seem like go usual b movie crappy fx sudden boom anime come movie go wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill animation bad cheap even bad remember speed racer crissake fact cheap one scene movie vividly remember bunch kid run school kid fx terrible dinosaur look bad godzilla addition transition live action animation unorganize dialogue voice especially english dub view horrid beg dad take tape dvd vhs player thing keep survive crack joke comment like robot joel mike mst3k pick season honestly way barely enjoy movie survive time heck plan show another fellow otaku pal mine halloween b movie night stupid pretty painful watch unintentionally hilarious time give movie 310 improvement 0 510 originally go give accord grading scale 310 mean pretty much boring bad fun count three unless find way make fun become fun count 15']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":16}]}]}
