# Problem
As a media company, helping local small and medium sized business through digital advertising is one of our main revenue streams. The advertising system is operated on its platforms such as Google, Facebook â€¦ The objective is to predict if a client will stop running advertising campaigns (churn).

# Data
The provided data science has ten columns as follows: <br>
**1. CPL_wrt_BC:** the change in CPL (cost per lead) of a client with respect to the business category. CPL is defined as the average amount of advertising dollars spent in order to get a lead (phone call or website click). <br>
**2. client_state:** location (50 states and DC) <br>
**3. duration:** the length of time a business has been a client (in months) <br>
**4. num_products:** the number of distinct advertising products the client has bought <br>
**5. calls:** number of calls the client received as a results of their advertising efforts <br>
**6. CPL_wrt_self:** the change in CPL in past three months <br>
**7. churn:** target column showing if a client's churned (1 for churn, 0 for retention) <br>
**8. avg_budget:** average monthly budget the client spends on advertising <br>
**9. BC:** client's business category <br>
**10. clicks:** number of clicks the client received as a result of their advertising effort <br>

# Challenge
- Perform data cleaning and exploration if necessary.
- Train a model that predicts churn and describe its performance.
- Justify the metrics for model evaluation.
- Present results and their insights.

# Deliverables
- A jupyter notebook containing the entire modeling workflow.
- A technical report (2 pages) includes the process, steps taken and final findings.
- A non-technical report (2 pages) summarizes the approach, key findings and recommended next steps for non-data science oriented audiences.
