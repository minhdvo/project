# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning
Build a convolutional neural network to classify images of letters from American Sign Language.

# Project Description
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by 
hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, 
along with facial gestures and bodily postures.
