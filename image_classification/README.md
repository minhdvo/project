# Deep Learning with Images <br>
Build a deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images. <br>
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, 
would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, you will build a simple deep learning 
model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation.

Python packages: keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy
