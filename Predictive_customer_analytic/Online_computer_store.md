# Online store
This use case best fits most of the real world cases encountered in predictive customer analytics. Imagine that this online store is 
analogous to Amazon.com. 
- Potential customers browse the website for products of their choice. 
- The website monitors customer activity through sessions. 
- Customers are tagged using cookies on their browser. 
- Individual customer activity is tracked within and across sessions to establish models that lead to customers ultimately buying the 
products. Once the customer adds products to the shopping cart, the store will also recommend products that the customer might be 
interested in. The store offers customer support and service through phone, chat, and email. 
- Customers can file complaints through any of the channels. 
- In addition, customers can provide reviews for the products and service. The store analyzes review commends and complaints to measure 
customer satisfaction levels. 

The store wants to retain customers for life by tracking potential times the customer would need other products or upgrades. 
They also run seasonal sales and offer discounts to entice customers to buy more. 
will use this business to study predictive customer analytics throughout the customer life cycle. 
Let me also introduce you to two customers we will be using throughout the course. 
- First, there is Roger who is a middle-aged executive with a family of four. He likes high-end products and is typically loyal to 
a business he works with. 
- Jessica who is in her twenties and a student. She is single. She always looks for deals and is willing to try out 
multiple vendors to catch the best offer possible.
