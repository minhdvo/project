The treaty entered into force on February 16, 2005, after it was ratified by enough countries to account for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 among the parties to the UNFCCC.\n","\n","Main objectives of the Kyoto Protocol:\n","\n","Emission Reduction Targets: The protocol established legally binding emission reduction targets for developed countries, also known as Annex I countries. These countries committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions collectively by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels during the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012.\n","\n","Flexible Mechanisms: To help countries meet their emission reduction targets cost-effectively, the Kyoto Protocol introduced three flexible mechanisms:\n","a. Emissions Trading: Allowed countries to buy and sell emission allowances among themselves.\n","b. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Enabled developed countries to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries and receive credits for the reductions achieved.\n","c. Joint Implementation (JI): Permitted developed countries to collaborate on emission reduction projects in other developed countries and receive credits.\n","\n","Adaptation Fund: The protocol established the Adaptation Fund to provide financial assistance to developing countries to help them cope with the impacts of climate change.\n","\n","Review and Compliance: The Kyoto Protocol implemented a rigorous system to review and assess countries' progress towards meeting their emission reduction targets and ensuring compliance with the treaty's provisions.\n","\n","The Kyoto Protocol was a significant milestone in international efforts to combat climate change. However, it also faced challenges, particularly due to the absence of emission reduction commitments for major developing countries, such as China and India. As a result, the protocol was not able to address the increasing emissions from these countries and was considered by some as insufficient to fully tackle the global climate crisis.\n","\n","In the years following its adoption, international climate negotiations continued, leading to the development of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Paris Agreement built upon the principles of the Kyoto Protocol but introduced a more inclusive and flexible approach, with countries setting their own voluntary emission reduction targets (Nationally Determined Contributions) to limit global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"l_X3bdV4xWeo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = questioner(question=\"When was the Kyoto Protocol adopted?\", context=kyoto_info)\n","print(result['answer'])"],"metadata":{"id":"bYv48FCttEL9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = questioner(question=\"What agreemnt was made in 2015?\", context=kyoto_info)\n","print(result['answer'])"],"metadata":{"id":"IQuwxsMqxyuM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## *Task 9.
